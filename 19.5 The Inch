## The inch

Bicycles and the act of riding them are, like any activity, cultural subjects. The concepts of riding can be picked up and co-opted or rewritten at will by anyone with a point to make about things ilke transport and leisure and class and the environment.

Bicycles have been presented as everything from the sleekest of athletic machines at the cutting edge of technology to the chosen transport of the demarkated poor. In the very early days hobby horses were ridden by rich thrill seekers from the first bike shop (a specialised smithee) on Long Acre. The Richard Bransons and Elon Musks of the day caused so much bother in the West End that the worlds first cycling ban quickly followed - no riding on the pavements in London. Since then we've had many trophes around cycling. We've had rowdy feminists in split skirts, we've had hostel-hopping inter-war socialists, front-basket toting hippies, front-basket toting vicar's wives, tatooed hipsters, cycle couriers and their rat racing, MAMILs, East Coast freedom loving MTBers, snake-hipped drugged up racers, gangs of East-end bicycle theives and billions of poor people not only going to work on their bikes but their bikes are enablers of work. Couriers, policemen, paratroopers, stormtroopers, posties, butcher's boys. The very hip artisnal bread makers down the bottom of the hill use a Eurobike to get their expensive loaves around the neighbourhood.  


At the same time there is something that unites all of these bikes as a riding experience. Chris Boardman on his Lotus has more in common with a postie on a pashley (those were the days) than I do with Lewis Hamilton. It's not that difficult to imagine Chris Boardman on a posite bike. It is very difficult to imagine me in a McLaren F1 car. 

Actually lets get even more extreme - here is the latest tri design from XXX. Bikes for tris have less contrictions placed on them by governing bodies (you're still not allowed a fairing) and the result is more extreme than anything on the Tour De France.

People who are not bike-nuts group bikes all together in one group labeled 'bike' just as I group all cars, from the Ferrari to the old banger, into one group called 'cars' in a way that Jeremy Clarkson simply would not comprehend. But to the bike but the bikes described above are all very different. Chris Boardman's Lotus track bike is a very different piece of engineering to the bikes that get sent to africa by multinationals as an act of charity.

And, even though they have similar labels on their parts, what do the bikes have in common? Kona's Africa bike could have been made 100 years ago, it's a living dinosaur in tech terms. Just about everything on the bicycle has evolved over the last hundred years to the point of the XXX. Concept bikes, those favourites of bike shows, give us bikes that measure and actively change shape to maximise aerodynamics, or have built in power sensors, GPS and the like.  

A simple index of change is the number of gears. Here's a history of the bicycle in numbers, an in-joke for the bike geek:

Which all leads me to ask a strange question - what is the minimum unit of a bicycle?

Beyond that the material of the tubes has changed from steel to alloy to carbon via bamboo, the ways that things are attached to each other has changed, wheels sizes have moved around a lot. In the last decade elements of the bicycle that have been stable for many decades have changed; the diameter of headset bearing you would think was pretty uncontoversial but in fast there's a lot of movement here, as with bottom brackets styles. The width of tyres is a movable feast with lively forum discussions to be had for the serious about the difference between a 23c and a 25c road tyres. Literally two mmilimetres.

Even the shape of the frame and where the rider sits in the bikew has changed a lot. The decision in ???? by the UCI to ban recumbents and fairings in cycle racing has meant that the recumbent has remained a niche development area, which is a shame given their out and out speed. That decision meant that effectively the racing position is not the fastest position on a bike and has led to decades of thoughtless adoption of the 'DF' standard by the majority of riders (and I am one of them).

Even the mthod of changing gear has evolved, from a little shaft and lever on the seat stay to the the electronic deraileur. Even bearings have changed in size, postiion and type. Is there nothing that is a constant? 

We have to get right down to the chain to find something that has remained the same. And even then the width of the chain and how it is made up has changed. Back in the day the chain was 1/4 inch wide. It's still that on track bikes, but derailer bikes have used narrower and narrower chains; 1/32 then XXX and then XXX and today we are on XXX. 

There are also historically and currently, shaft-drive and belt drive bicycles.



 






In london at least there is one group of bike riders who typify societies general attitude to riding a bike though. The baby-crim gangs of ten to twelve year olds who ride around in packs pulling wheelies on their stolen hybrids. Just like my society back in the seventies bikes were seen
