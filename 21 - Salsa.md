As you have probably figured out by now the 'rhythm' of my bicycle acquisition changed aroound ten years ago. Up until 2008 I had pretty much had one bike at a time but then middle age hit.

No tomato red ferraris, no marathon de sable, no pursusing old bands I used to like or collecting Manga or creating EDM on my macbook. No discovering gardening or dogs or baking. Middle age for me meant purusing cycling and computers and writing - pretty much the exact same obcessions I had been pursuing for the last twenty years - just multiplied by age and income.

Perhaps I am more boring than I thought. I like to think of it as further submersion, a descent into mastery. Is it a coincidence that old cyclists get to race in something called the Masters league? Or is that just a polite way of saying 'past it old dudes'?

Certainly after 35 your out and out power drops and as you drift on through your forties you realise that, while you are riding as hard as very did perceptually, objectively you are slowing down a little. You simply don't have the ability to sustain top-end power. This is largely why you get that massive tail off in sports in the early to mid thirties - the body just can't do 110% anymore.

I am no retro grouch. I don't feel the need to recreate my youth. I was in enough of a hurry to get out if it that the idea of returning is ludicrous. I don't have a craving for an old ALAN bike to hang on my wall and my one toe-dipping into classic bikes had ended very badly (last episode).

No, I realised that a modern Ford Fiesta eats a Ferrari from the 70s for lunch. And when Chris Boardman said his entry level road bike from his inaugural road bike range way back in 2005 was as good as the bikes he used to ride the Tour de France on back in the 90s he was absolutely right. And it cost about a tenth.  The changes might have been subtle but bikes were always getting better and cheaper.

And I had to have more. Where once a bike would have been good for five years I was slowly working my way into a postion where I had five bikes on the go at the same time and parts for two or three more in the attic. Shameful really. And it makes writing about them all quite difficult. I can't just sum up parts of my life in one bike as I've been doing previously. No, I am going to have to be more selective and pull out episodes more directly.

To help you keep a track on this I have produced a spreadsheet. No, to be honest I had to create a spreadsheet to remember which bike was bought when. It's a shameful document, a register of time wasted online looking for parts, of endless searching for a perfect bike, that thing which can never really exist because bikes are continually developing just as what I am riding them for shifts too. 

My life in London is a conscious choice but I know there are downsides. I have few of my very old friends around me and the physical enviroment, even with the escape of Epping Forest, is more limited. On the upside the cultural life of London is extraordinary and the job prospects unrivalled. Sometimes, no a lot of the time, I feel like I don't fit. I guess that's the price of immigration, even a relatively easy one like mine. 

And that makes me fidgety. I am naturally curious and have a lot of energy and without anywhere to put it I get antsy and frustrated. I really have to put my attention somwhere - I am not one to relax by lying by a pool, I am more likley to be writing a play or walking up to the rocky outcrop in the heat of the midday sun to look down on that pool. I am always zooming in or out of experience, trying to get another view on it. The experience of cycling is good for me because I just have to be where I am, but when I am off the bike I am very good at being somewhere else.    

My particular addiction at the time was cycling forums with second-hand parts and frames on them. Singletrack has a good one, as does bikeradar. I had found my Rock Lobster on Singletrack and it was a stellar buy at £150. My next bike I found on the Bikeradar site for £90, a stupidly low price really. Of course to get the good buys you have to hover endlessly, like some 19th century opium soaked dandy forever wandering the upper reaches of Holloway Road (I'm look at you, De Quincey). 

And it wasn't just frames. Below are two photos from around 2013. One is bike parts I wanted to keep and the other is bike parts I could sell...


That's quite a lot of parts right? Aside from cables, tyres and disc pads 75% of those piles was bought second hand and 25% on deep sale. I had a policy of never paying retail price. I suppose that made it easier to justify the spend. 

Don't get me wrong, I like to build up a bike and think about how a certain ride will fit together to make a great bike for a certain purpose. I am not a telented mechanic but I can put together a bike that won't kill me. I have paid a professional mechanic three times since my fourteenth year. Once to refurbish the suspension on my Scott in 1995, once last year to rebuild my fixie becuase I couldn't get the bottom bracket unfrozen with home tools and once just recently because it was in the terms and conditions of a warranty replacement.
